**#LifeAfterGrad** for Fatima Adnan (BSc (Honors) Economics and Mathematics-Class of 2012)

"This world rates your success on the basis of your salary digits which I don’t believe in. Being a LUMS graduate you are expected to be working at some high designation in a multinational company earning lucrative salary or post graduating from top ranking university. But my story isn’t a typical successful LUMS graduate story. 

I joined LUMS in 2008 and selected Econ and Math as a major. The beautiful thing about LUMS is the diversity of courses it offers .Being an Econ & Math major I was not restricted to take courses from my own field but was free to study courses from any other field I liked. For the first time in life I got to know how interesting was sociology, anthropology, history and law studies. Learning Islamic spirituality from Dr. Kamal ud din was a wonderful experience. It was the first time I studied Islamic Studies comprising of topics other than the basic five pillars of islam. Learning Pakistan studies with Dr Ejaz Akram opened up complete new lines of thinking. With tense debates, discussions, differing of opinions and talks with great minds I have learnt a lot. I came from Matric /Fsc background in which you are emphasized to learn things more than understanding them. LUMS has taught me to analyse, understand and comprehend. This absolute expediency has helped me throughout my life. 

In my #Life After Grad, unlike most of my batch fellows I got married right after graduation. I worked as HR manager in a cooking oil company for a year and left job after my first baby was born. But I continued my online business.  I decided to give my valuable time to my child. I faced a lot of criticism from friends and family that I wasted my education. But I didn’t allow these social pressures to change my mind because I believe I am NOT actually  wasting my time instead I am making long term investment in my children which will be for which I will be repayed not only in this world but also in the hereafter. Moreover by the nature of my husband’s job we are bound to travel around the country, shifting to new places after 2 or 3 years. So far now I have travelled from Kashmir to Kashmore (interior Sindh) from Peshawar to Pindi and from Multan to Murree. In short I have got the opportunity to live and experience the diverse culture of Pakistan. For this period apparently my career growth was stagnant but in reality my personal gain are beyond explanation. I have seen the real Pakistan. Its true dynamic fearless nation, potential filled land and hardworking folk. May be I have only learnt economic policy making at LUMS. But only material written in books can never offer the solution to actual problems until you experience the real life problems. Without witnessing the economic and social deprivation at grassroots level you can never bring the reforms. My experience has helped to gain me what I could have never learnt sitting in air conditioned office at a large metropolitan city. The first-hand experience I have gained during this period is worthy to help me make practical use of theories I have learnt at LUMS. My thirst for knowledge has not been quenched neither it would be at any stage. Insha ALLAH I have plans to complete my masters  may be in next few years (or might be with my kids ;)  ).These years will pass and I will again take off my career too. But I’ll always be happy of choosing whatever I feel right. I think no one should ever let the fear of society dominate his/her voice. You should et your voice be heard. You should write your own success story.

Allhamdulillah I am proud wife of most supportive husband and mother of two cutest sons.  I am happy and content with my successful life. Thankyou LUMS for giving me the most beautiful memories of my life."
