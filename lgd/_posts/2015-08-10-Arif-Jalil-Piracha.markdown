**#LifeAfterGrad** for Arif Jalil Piracha (BSc (Honors) Economics-Class of 1999 and MBA-Class of 2000)

"I am an old Aitchisonian, so essentially grew up with friends who had a business background. My father also worked for himself and established himself as the most successful GP in his county, in the UK, so for me I think this exposure put me in the direction of wanting to do my own business.

At the time when I was applying for LUMS, LUMS was only for a select few and it was the MBA program that was recognized globally as a successful international program. So it was no wonder that my parents and I had an ambition for me to apply to LUMS for the MBA program. Since I was interested in eventually starting my own business, it only made sense to learn business from the premier business school.

I majored in Economics in the undergraduate program, and focused on marketing in the MBA. No company can survive without marketing! As the plan was for me to start up a business, I needed the relevant tools to be able to sell the organisation to clients. I think this focus on marketing was what has helped me establish myself.

I wanted to read up and understand what other companies, locally and globally, did to succeed. I wanted to learn the success factors, and also the failure factors. I was looking for a balanced view of success and failures, and wanted to understand how these learnings could be applied in the local environment.

I had very little expectations from the undergrad program. The idea was for this to be a stepping stone for the MBA program admission. It was bound to add weight for admission, having completed an undergraduate program from the same institution. Given these low expectations, I went through the BSc program very smoothly (pst, did not learn that much in this program!). Although I majored in economics, I haven’t been really able to utilise any of the learnings in the business environment.

My time at LUMS was more than amazing. I strongly proclaim that back in the day we were blessed with the crème de la crème of international and Pakistani faculty members. There was so much to do, so much to learn, so much to apply. And the case study methodology made it even easier and fun to learn.

As an entrepreneur, I strongly feel that 70% of a business success depends on who you know! I have been blessed with a great networking fraternity, starting from Aitchison going all the way to LUMS. I know for sure that had I not studied here, then my own business would have been but a dream.

Your own business is all about struggling. The environment in Pakistan, from the legals to the corporates, is all hopscotch and flawed. The key to surviving is simple, keep calm and believe in murphys law. This is our core belief. I would also recommend people to download Gibb’s 50 rules (Gibbs was this guy from aTV serial program called NCIS)

As an organization grows and as a person matures, needs / goals / achievements keep changing accordingly. At the time when I started up, I was newly wedded. Now, by the grace of God, I have 3 children and 3 businesses! I can confidently say, however, that God has been kind. In times of need he has always been looking down on us! As far as fear is concerned, that will always remain. Can we sustain ourselves? What if we do not get any business next week? Next month? Next year? These are all pertinent questions, and I feel that it is this fear that makes us work harder.

I passionately believe that there is no point in going abroad to study unless you plan to stay abroad. For anyone wanting to start a business in Pakistan, one needs to collect the relevant local knowledge. Half the road to success lies in your courage, determination and passion to do something. If you are only doing it for the money, then you are in the wrong business."
