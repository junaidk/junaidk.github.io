**#LifeAfterGrad** for Usman Javed (BSc Mathematics-Class of 2010)

"LUMS was like living inside a bubble, unexposed to the real world, with friends just like family who knew me inside out and an entire community of support. Despite this, by the end of my stipulated 4 years of graduation, I was nowhere near finished with my degree. Everyone around me, my friends and batch mates were all moving on to bigger and better things – graduation, further studies, travel etc. – while I actually felt I had gone backwards. I had to take a couple of semesters off with fractured bones while playing volleyball and this further aggravated my situation, making me angry and frustrated. I gave myself a hard time every day for letting this happen and for not doing anything earlier. I had no short term plan or long term goals, no vision or idea of where I wanted to end up, making me feel increasingly lost. The idea of a career, or even a job opportunity was the last thing on my mind. Hell, I didn’t even know what I was good at or wanted to do to earn my bread and butter. 

The only thing I knew was that I wanted to study further, to learn more, and perhaps one day teach the one thing that made sense; Mathematics. My fascination with teaching Mathematics started when I was giving Math tuitions during my last year of LUMS, to all the students from Freshmen to Seniors, students who were even a year or two above me. And with the extra money, I managed to pay half the fee for my final semester myself, making me even more confident of my abilities. What had started out just as something I wanted to try my hand at became a responsibility for me - of someone’s education, of people looking up to you for guidance, and it made me reevaluate and focus on my life goals and priorities once again. And today, I work proudly at four schools within my city, while also teaching a couple of evening classes (to O’ & A’ Level students, as well as GRE & SAT tuitions). The energy that I get from teaching, mentoring and guiding these young, receptive and inquisitive individuals is something I can’t put into words. It drives me to do better, and be better every single day and there is nothing else I love more."
