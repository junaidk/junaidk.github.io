**#LifeAfterGrad** for Abdul Wasay (BSc Computer Science-Class of 2014)

"It took me 6 weeks to get back to the admins of this page. If you are reading this, you have their patience to be thankful for. As my 4 years at LUMS defined me more than anything else has, or ever will, I couldn’t decide what part of it to share. At the end, I decided to talk about the hidden one-sadness.  Don’t get me wrong. LUMS remains the best thing to ever happen to me. It is all I ever wanted, it is where I felt home, loved, cared etc. but it is also where I occasionally cried, felt rejected, lonely and, sometimes, lost. 

When we laugh, we laugh-out-loud, but when we are sad, we go to our rooms, we hide our faces, we reach out to a supportive shoulder. I want to lay bare that, unsung, experience of my 4 years at LUMS. My hope is to relate to a shared set of troubled experiences that we go through and grow out of. So, in no particular order, here we go: 

I cried, repeatedly, I still do. Five years ago, after years of very protected upbringing, I was released into the wild. I wasn’t the star child anymore. Everyone spoke better english, well almost everyone. People were rich, they had macbooks and iphones. Hell, they were smarter too. And frankly, most looked better than I did. Oh and don’t even get me started on the SSE curriculum ... Those nights, the 18-year-old-me would call back home and cry to his mother (Boo, what a wuss). Well, the 23-year-old-me still cries. Crying is good. It is the purest form of expressing emotions to oneself. The instance a tear rolled down my cheek, I knew I felt. I knew I was hurt. I knew I was in love. I knew I was angry. I knew I was alive.. More importantly, I knew things needed to change. I cry wholeheartedly, I weep, I let it all out, however, I try not to cry twice for the same thing. 

I was lost, God knows, still am. Indeed, LUMS was about choices; choices I never had before: Chicken Stroganoff or Karhi phulki ? Library or SSE ? M.M Alam or Shahlmi ? Biology or Computer Science ? You get the picture. I didn’t know which pill to take and there were quite a few pills, quite a lot of them. Well, making choices was hard, is still is. But making choices is not optional. Stay lost. It is fine (for now at least), but keep making choices. Sometimes based on intuition, sometimes based on careful thinking and, every now and then, just hold a loved ones hand and ask them what to do. Go ahead, apply for that internship but also apply for 100 others. Go and talk to that sexy person but also talk to a bunch more. Take that 2 AM trip to Anarkali, but also make that 8 AM class. Celebrate birthdays in front of SSE, but also make that group project work. Don’t make up your mind, if you don’t want to, but keep making it happen.

My 4 years at LUMS ended but when all was done, here is what I learned: All’s well that ends well. If it is not all well, it can still end well. All that ends badly, is not all bad. And ,of course, eventually it ends. It ends to make way for new beginnings."

About Wasay:
Wasay is currently pursuing his doctoral degree in computer science from Harvard University and a resident tutor at Quincy House. When not crying or being lost, he spends his time learning new things and gathering new experiences.
