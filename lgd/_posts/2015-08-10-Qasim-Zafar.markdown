**#LifeAfterGrad** for Qasim Zafar (BSc Electrical Engineering-Class of 2014)

"There have been so many inspirational posts on this page, and behind each one of them a truly wonderful and amazing person, that when I was asked to share my **#LifeAfterGrad** I was truly pressured. It’s been a month since, and only now have I mustered the courage to sit down with pen and paper (more like sit down with the laptop, but that’s not as poetic now, is it?)

I would like to talk not about my story or to give advice, but rather talk about my state of mind, and the junction at which I stand today. I just left my first startup, Savaree, a few weeks ago. What was a blaze of accolade after accolade and possibly the most well-publicized startup in recent months turned out not to be for me. And as I sit at home and think, one thing bothers me: where do I go from here? Do I take the lucrative offers for employment that people have been proposing? Do I take up one of the partnership offers that I have? Do I take the GRE and go for graduate school? And the question that answers all of these, what do I want?

This question bothers me the most because what we want to do is not necessarily what we can do, and I honestly believe that at some point in our lives, we decide to give up chasing our dreams and settle. We settle for the best option that we have, instead of trying to make what we want an option. And there’s nothing wrong with that, because it is the sensible choice. And most of us have to be sensible – there are many faces looking up to us and most of us feel the pressure or at least the responsibility to reach a ‘muqaam’ in life, if for nothing else than to not let these faces down. Somewhere along the way, we come to the painful realization of life’s harsh realities, and that we must let go of many of our dreams and grow up. And that’s a sad thing.

I’ve ‘missed’ more opportunities in life than are even possible for many people, and every time I forego what seems to those around me the opportunity of a lifetime, I feel that I’ve given them a slap across the face. It’s not all about what people see on the outside, and maybe their aspirations are not ideal, but sometimes it’s still painful to see the reactions on people’s faces when they realize that I had what they dream of in the palm of my hand, what they would take in a heartbeat, and I let it go. I’ve turned down some great job offers. I opted to attend LUMS instead of a dream college in the US. I’ve got a US citizenship and a good academic and extracurricular track record but dammit, I’m still loitering around Iqbal Town.

On top of that, there are many things that I started but was not able to finish, and a hundredfold more that I have not even started, because life happened. There are so many things to make that my room is full of half-baked projects, so many books to read that half the library in my house is yet unread, so many things to learn that I don’t know a percent of what I see when I look at the world around me. And a third of my life is already over. And that is where the stress and anxiety starts building up. Gosh, we grow up too quickly. And that’s also a sad thing.

But at the same time, there really isn’t anything to worry about. After all, my family went broke several times but something happened at just the right time to patch things up. And then we became pretty well off. And then my dad died. And we struggled at first, but now it’s been ten years and we’re doing great. My sibs are awesome at school and college, and I’ve been alright too. I’ve reached this stage of my life, and I’m not doing too bad, so I guess it all works out.

So instead of freaking out, I have a plan. I will in the coming weeks explore my opportunities, hedge my bets and figure out what I should do career-wise so that I am both happy and living up to people’s expectations. I don’t know what that will be, but looking back, I will have it figured out. If not now, then a few weeks from now.

And in the meanwhile, I will be productive on my own. I will work as hard as I’ve ever worked, on multiple fronts. I will teach myself more of what I feel is an education – the arts – as opposed to the trade – electrical engineering – that I have formally studied. Make no mistake, I love EECS and will tinker away on the little projects in my room, while also completing the Data Science specialization I’m working on. And most of all, I will focus on reducing some of the backlog of ‘life’ that I have accumulated. And that’s a happy thing."

About Qasim: 
Qasim graduated from LUMS in 2014 with a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering, after three years of shifting majors between that and computer science. Three weeks ago, he left Savaree, the startup he cofounded while still a student, to focus on what’s next. When not pondering the bittersweet beauty of life, his homeschooling has taught him how to keep himself busy and never get bored.
