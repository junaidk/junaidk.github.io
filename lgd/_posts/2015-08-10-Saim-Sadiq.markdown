**#LifeAfterGrad** for Saim Sadiq (BSc (Honors) Anthropology/Sociology-Class of 2014)

"I am not sure what purpose a long write-up like this is supposed to serve. I guess it is meant to inspire you with some great story of post-graduate success and I am afraid I might not have it. However, what I do have is a reflection from my own time at LUMS and after it, which might put quite a few things in perspective for you regarding what you want to do with your life. 

Back in 2010 when I joined it, getting into LUMS seemed more like an end in itself rather than a means to get to an end. In my freshman year, I was the epitome of what a shitty student is supposed to be like. I slept my way through Economics classes, I thought Dr. Noman ul Haq was so low on patience and so high on fluster that he had no business being a teacher to uncontrollable undergrads (regardless of the fact that he had more knowledge than the rest of my instructors put together). I even took French in my very first semester and almost failed it too. I mean who the f*** takes French so early on and then flunks it? (I got saved because the TA was really nice). In that sense, I can serve as the perfect example that must not be followed.  

By then, I didn’t have a definitive idea about what my career was supposed to be like but I knew that I didn’t want what most people seemed to be after. I realized early on that I couldn’t spend my life adding digits and reading theories about things that didn’t matter to me, by people who didn’t matter to me, for a career that I didn’t even want.  

So in sophomore year, I switched my major to Anthropology, primarily because it seemed like the only fascinating item on the menu (Four years later, my degree doesn’t fool me and I am certain that I am not an anthropologist by any stretch). I was always mad about movies but now I found myself impulsively pursuing random projects related to film. It was here that LUMS started playing a definitive part in my life. 
Ambitiously enough, I tried my hand at making a feature length film that was shot and edited but that never really got an audience. I was able to do that because there was a student club that trigger started this project with me. I partnered up with friends here and there to make videos and really started giving my passion a real chance only to come to terms with the fact that I had to be filmmaker. In fact, that was all I could be. I didn’t really have any other talent. So if your prospective career is not to be found in exact courses and majors being offered, you can still figure a way around it and align yourself with student societies, people, and ideas that help you learn what you want to. 

At LUMS, I genuinely didn’t give a shit about my academics. I somehow managed a 3.1, bunked classes, travelled to seven different countries, made a risky documentary about blasphemy laws for my SPROJ, won Model UN awards, organized an international student conference, failed quizzes, laughed them off, and made friends who genuinely matter. And in all this imperfection, I lived the most regretless experience of my life. 

LUMS gave me the confidence to convince my parents, who are rather conservative. Of course, I had to start by convincing them that filmmaking was, indeed, an actual career. It wasn’t just them. Even today, a lot of people (of our age too) look at me with confusion and pity when I tell them what I am doing with my life. Some of them are too numb in the comfort of their corporate careers to be familiar with the thrill of creating something. And I believe that’s okay, as long as you chalk your path out for yourself instead of following someone’s career blueprint, it’s all good. Don’t be afraid to break the clutter and lose out on your individuality. But don’t break the clutter just for the heck of it either. You might be made for a kickass career at a corporation or something 180 degrees opposed to it. 

Please give yourself the chance to figure that out and don’t let your parents and the people around you decide it for you. Don’t take silly advice regarding what pay cheque comes with what job and all such accompanying bullshit. The purpose of your education should not be to get you a job and the purpose of your job should not be to get you money. Just focus on finding out what you would really want to work on throughout your life. Operate as if it were a free world and lock down a talent, an interest that you would love to translate into a profession. Everything else, the money, the trips, and the perks will follow suit. The worst thing you can do is come out of LUMS not knowing what you want to do with your life. 

In the one year since graduation, I have been working as the Assistant Director on a demanding mainstream television project. On an average, I am at work for 16 hours a day as we shoot and I genuinely love it even more than I loved my LUMS life. I have also started a media initiative with a friend called Tamasha that aims for social change through short films, videos etc. and whatever little work we have done so far has earned us much satisfaction. 

Post-graduate success can and should mean different things to different people. I don’t know if I am successful. But I know that I am happy and I am good at what I do. And for a life worth living, this is all that should matter."
