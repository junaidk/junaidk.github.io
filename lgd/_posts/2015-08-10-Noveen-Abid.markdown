**#LifeAfterGrad** for Noveen Abid (BSc (Honors) Sociology-Class of 2010) 
 
"LUMS gave me so much but five years down the road frankly all I remember is a happy blur of amazing times and friends and all nighters injected with junk food and the belief that we were the best and could literally achieve anything. Come graduation- a teaching job at my alma mater landed in my lap and I started teaching Sociology just to try it out. I loved it. And now, I'm married with a daughter, still teaching, very passionate about that, writing and managing two blogs and keeping my hands completely full! I consider myself to be lucky to love what I'm doing and to be able to continue it - in this age, one person can have multiple callings! Remember if you could write a paper in half a night, you can do anything!"

About Noveen: 
Noveen graduated from LUMS in 2010 with a degree in Sociology/Anthropology. She has since then, taught at LGS, Beaconhouse and is currently teaching at LACAS. She hopes to complete her masters one day and start teaching Sociology at a higher level. She loves getting inspired by her students and feels that to be able to teach these young minds and to have them look up to you is the best thing about her job. 
She also has plans to do a cooking course and become a crazy amazing chef! Her blog is called A Big Fat Yum!
