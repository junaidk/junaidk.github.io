**#LifeAfterGrad** for Jahanzaib Shafique (BSc (Honors) Economics and Mathematics-Class of 2009)

"LUMS was not an option for me; it was where I had always pictured myself. Trusting my gut feeling I never bothered to apply at any other university and opted for the BSc in Economics and Maths programme at LUMS. I knew I would never be working in a field that involved Econ or Maths but it helped me in polishing my business skills and my approach towards solving problems. I always knew that I had an entrepreneurial mindset and these subjects would help me refine it. Theory is kind of irrelevant when it comes to practical life and this degree was closest to the “real” world.
 
Perhaps the biggest contribution of LUMS in my life would be the networking opportunity it provided me with and gave me a better understanding of life. Life at LUMS also taught me how to manage deadlines and multitasking :) . To be honest, I have skipped a major part of my class lectures at college since I was working alongside and often had to bail out in the middle of classes for meetings. My GPA took a hit in the later half of my degree; I am not being boastful but well,  I knew I was already earning more than a graduate & working for companies where my fellow batchmates will eventually be dropping their resumes. I used to spend half of my day at the office (that I was running) and the rest half at the university and with different class timings every quarter/semester I often found myself driving between the two at times even 3-4 times a day. I also worked for LUMS while I was still a student and somewhat managed to balance the money equation with them. I guess if I laid my company’s foundation before becoming a Luminite, it definitely fully flourished in the **#LifeAfterGrad**.
 
To become a success story, one has to be committed to their ultimate goal. Persistence, ability to take risk and think out of the box sounds clichéd but are the golden rules of the game. "Ambition is the path to success and persistence is the vehicle you arrive in." "
