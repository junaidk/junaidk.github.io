**#LifeAfterGrad** for Sannan Ijaz (BSc Electrical Engineering-Class of 2013)

"Coming from a quintessential middle class family, like many others (although I do hope this trend changes) I had only two options-medicine or engineering. Doing well until high school, I believed that college would be the same. Well, it turned out to be a huge misconception… and I mean huge. I struggled through four years of Electrical Engineering. The curriculum put me through much pressure that resulted in many consecutive sleepless nights, anxiety, and lack of self-belief. Every semester, I had to tell my self the clichéd line, “Is semester ache grades bus”, and each semester I failed hilariously, like life itself was mocking me.  Well, I made it through and came to Melbourne for my Masters. I started studying for Electrical Engineering here as well, but after taking a few management and economic subjects, I decided to switch to management. This decision could not have been better. Sometimes, even I am surprised at how well swapping streams has done for me. I am working in a telecom company part time, which is being greatly complemented by my learning at university. 

It’s only been two years since I have graduated from LUMS. While I think that not much has happened to impart any kind of advice to the students, here are a few pointers I wish I knew while I were still there. 

•Be selfish: 
LUMS is a great place to develop yourself. Amidst the diversity it has to offer, try to find out what inspires you. Give yourself time. Find out what you like, and aspire for something bigger and better than a mere grad school degree or a job. Find an aim for yourself and work towards achieving it everyday. Everything else will follow. Remember that your life is nobody’s business but your own and you should take that business seriously. It took me a while to do just that, so the sooner the better.

•Recognize your strengths and weaknesses:
Focus on your strengths and play with them but be wary of your weaknesses too. You will soon find out what you want and how you want to achieve it. Recognizing one’s strengths takes time and effort and a wide variety of experiences. So, relax and just try to know yourself better. Cuz whats more important than that, eh?

•Take risks:
Step out of your comfort zone. Put yourself in unfamiliar situations and come out of them. You will surprise yourself with how quickly you adapt, transform and evolve. 

•Learn from the diversity LUMS has to offer:
Learn to respect each person’s values and points of view and develop your own. Gather a better understanding of people’s sensibilities and bask in this shared web of culture, which is LUMS. Perhaps, this is the most valuable lesson I learnt from LUMS and it helps me to this day.

•Persist:
With each event you count as a loss, push harder, push smarter. Ultimately, I believe we all get what we want from life, we just have to put in the right amount of patience and persistence. In the words of Miley Cyrus, “Ain't about how fast I get there, Ain't about what's waitin' on the other side, It's the climb.”

•Cherish every moment:
As one of my friends once asked me, “Tell me, what will we remember after these four years? Will we remember our grades, our assignments, or will we remember the friendships, the bonds and the memories?” Even then I knew the answer and it’s definitely not the first one."
