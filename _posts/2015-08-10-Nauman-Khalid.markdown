**#LifeAfterGrad** for Nauman Khalid (BSc (Honors) Political Science-Class of 2014)

"My story when compared to my fellow colleagues is rather humble. However, since I’ve been given the opportunity, I’d like to share it with you guys hoping that it may have something worthwhile to take from.

The first time I heard of LUMS was in 2007 and back then, I used to pronounce it LUM-B-S. It’s embarrassing to admit but that’s the truth about it.  After participating in a couple of events at LUMS and being completely swept off my feet by the caliber of its facilities and students, I decided that it would be a dream come true to be part of this prestigious institute. 

Although I had been accepted in a couple of universities abroad with decent scholarships, nothing had given me more joy than the acceptance offer that came in March from LUMS.  I decided to join LUMS in the Fall of 2010 with aspirations to become an Econ major. Immediately after joining, I faced obstacles that hindered my ability to perform. I failed to adjust to the culture and as a result, my grades suffered. 

With the passage of each week, pursuing an Econ major became improbable and the only thing I could wish for was to stay away from academic probation. I started doubting my decision of joining LUMS and I started doubting my capabilities as well.  But being an active member of the student societies helped me manage the pressure.

I was active member of the LUMS Media Arts Society. Being rejected for almost all positions I applied for, I was disheartened but I didn’t give up. Most of my friends became members of the Executive Council in their Junior Year, I barely stemmed my position in the extended council by then. In my final year, I ended up becoming the President of LMA. Spearheading a society at LUMS gave me the opportunity to experiment with a lot of managerial and marketing notions. Despite no technical know-how of film making, I, along with a team of some extremely talented individuals, had the honor of producing and premiering the first ever feature-film movie at LUMS.

**#LifeAfterGrad**uation for me has been a very nurturing journey so far. Here are my 2 cents for all aspiring graduates

Have a vision
This is perhaps the most critical advice that I can give you guys; Have a vision that guides you through and through. Make sure you have a clear objective that you want to obtain from your time here at LUMS. And no, a 4.0 GPA or joining an MNC are not what you call a vision. These should be nothing more than small check points on your path towards obtaining your vision.

GPA isn’t everything
Many folks left right and center would tell me that with a political science degree and a GPA as low as mine, my chances of securing a decent job are meek. 1 year after graduation, I cannot emphasize enough on how wrong they were. I’m not suggesting that GPA isn’t critical, what I’m saying is that it isn’t worth fretting for. Measure yourself beyond the quantifiable metrics. GPA is by no means a viable metric to gauge your capabilities against. 
 
Follow someone
Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba talked about this in one of his interviews as well. And when I look in retrospect, I see the effect that this has had on me. During my stay at LUMS, I followed a lot of my seniors and revered them. This helped instill ambition in me and also gave me a sense of direction. 

There’s more to take from the course pack and lectures
You’ve heard this a lot already that you learn more beyond the realm of the books and courses than you do from them. This is true. What’s more fascinating is the impact that it has on you. The smallest of things can have massive impact on your life and the way you perceive things. For instance, the only thing I learned from the entire Western Political Philosophy course was the word “telos” which means purpose or goal. And I cannot explain what impact it has had on me. So don’t shy away from these little things, these can have a bigger impact on you than you can imagine.

What you do matters, not where you work
By the end of your Senior year, you’ll find yourself in a rat-race of who gets into an MNC and who earns more. It doesn’t matter where you work, what matters is the kind of work you do. Yes working for an MNC is great but if at the end of the day you’re selling toilet cleaner or merely maintaining stocks for a particular raw material (both of which are highly likely), then what’s the whole point of working in an MNC. If you’re thinking long-term career growth, then you should pursue a job that gives you exposure and a learning opportunity in the initial part of your career."
