LifeAfterGrad for Areej Naseem (BSc (Honors) Social Science-Class of 2010)

"Four years at LUMS, I tried three different majors: i. Accounting and Finance, ii. Computer Science and iii. Social Science, and graduated with a concentration in Anthropology on one hand while being recommended to pursue Literature stream on the other hand. Today, I am an amateur poet for I kept alive the spirit I inherited from my school, the spirit of education for life. Let me relate how it is a delightful cherry on the top.

I graduated as a Social Science major and tried my luck in the corporate sector, Local Seth Culture of Sufi Group of Industries. Twice I wrote my resignation which was not accepted and one fine morning I was fired just like that. It was a mixed feeling. As a market research analyst everyone appreciated my work but a LUMS graduate who survived there described the issue in just the right words, "You are okay mostly but the moment the entrepreneur in you wakes up: its a sudden crash of your whole image in this Sufi Seth culture". 

After a long break and a time of spiritual personal growth, I returned to work. I was doing alright at Leo Communications, a company that now owns about six channels including Filmax and Filmazia. One fine morning I just felt it is too monotonous. I made the mistake of resigning from there and joined an advertising firm, for deep down in my head, a dream of owning an advertising firm was brewing. I resigned on a good note and said 'hello' to a new world. 

This is what LUMS makes you, a small imaginative kid with sadly low time margin of concentration. But on the brighter side, this is really what our country lacks. We are already pretty late catching up on developmental plan.

I was hired as some diplomat sort. The owner once accompanied me to a meeting with Metro who had an in house creative team. A largely wasteful endeavour and I could hardly do anything for I was just settling in, perhaps. I was fired within a month and I really looked forward to it for it was the most awkward place I ever worked at. If given resources and time I might have made my mark. I take it as a tit for tat though. I resigned wrongly so I must be denied time to settle too.

I  helped ACG Pakistan, finally once self owned advertising firm of my ex-husband. Within six months we were making about 1.5 lac a month on almost zero investment. I was all rounder in the firm, mostly advising on almost everything and doing the graphic work as well. It was fun but a dangerous passion. I could almost miss my prayer working on illustrator. I would design things just for the sake of designing. Thankfully, given the norms, I was denied all share of the profit at the time of divorce plus any association with the company. Only if Pakistani laws imitated UK laws or if I had been outside Pakistan, things would have been different. But I am glad to know that I gave up on mere passions.

Afterwards I joined Beaconhouse School System as career advisor. My students are going to IVY league colleges and other international colleges. It's fun working with young lot. Plus as it is a school job, I get plenty of time to do my stuff. Telling students to pursue their passions motivates oneself too. I enjoy poetry and let me share some here.

I opened a hand long in fist 
To make a sign that warns 
But the decadence within the grip
Way too visible and strong by then
Attracted many bright stars 
The clown scowled and then shrugged off
The artist could not help but endured 
The lover took it as a high five And striked
The mason sat in awe and wondered
The mother of all stars kissed it then 
I pulled it back then, turned it towards my face 
It seemed right, ugly and totally flawed
Miserably dejected within 
I shrinked up again
Now I twisted and turned my fist 
The gleam from my hand 
As captured henceforth refreshed me within
All the anger once gone recomense the song
All the horror faced makes a comedy show
The lighter the weight within 
More and more it holds and sustains of it all
And wiser is a sinner who picks up new tricks
As I pour some water over myself
The filth And scraps flow and float within
When you Let go of what knocks within
Warm is all that is sunny and grin
A book once opened must be read till the end
You see A pen held in the hand 
Must write something there and then
If I do not begin how shall I ever end"
