**#LifeAfterGrad** for Anum Imran (BSc (Hons) Economics and Political Science-Class of 2013)

“As I look back on my life, I realize that every time I thought I was being rejected from something good; I was actually being redirected to something better”.

I start my story with this quote, as it resonates with me on a deep, personal level as I’m sure it would with many of you. Also, that is how my LUMS story started.

I will condense my story to three instances that illustrate how this quote played out in my life.

1. In school, I was one of those people wanting to go abroad to study from the get-go. I applied to the top universities in the US for undergrad and despite a few acceptances, it did not work out as I got no funding. I came to LUMS then, not really knowing what to expect and only having visited it once before I applied. Long story short – it turned out to be one of best things that happened to me. Looking back now, I would choose to do my undergraduate from LUMS, any day, anytime. LUMS offered a wide range of courses, excellent professors, extracurricular and leadership opportunities and of course, lasting friendships and memories. It provided an opportunity to have a wholesome experience.

2. In my senior year, I applied to the University of Toronto for graduate school, as my family was moving to Canada. I did not apply to a lot of places as I knew I wanted to go to U of T for the Political Economy program and to be honest I was fairly confident given that I had decent grades and resume. But sometimes life does not work that simply. I waited and waited for a decision and March passed, April passed, May passed, and still there was no response. Needless to say I panicked. All other deadlines had passed expect for Carleton and so I applied there and got accepted within a few weeks. I got funding, they had excellent co-op and internship options in their MA Political Science program and so I paid my residence deposit and was all set to go. That is when U of T sent their response (a pretty late yes). It was late in the summer and I had already made my decision (funding played a major role in my decision) and I started at Carleton in September. Initially, there were times when I questioned my decision and started to think I should have gone to U of T, given its name recognition and ranking. I do not question my decision anymore. Carleton proved to be the better decision in the long run. It is located in Ottawa which is Canada’s capital city and is a hub for political science jobs, as I discovered when I started applying for work opportunities.

3. As part of my Masters co-op program, I applied for jobs and last summer I got accepted to work in a federal government department in Ottawa. I was ecstatic to say the least as it is a highly competitive process. Then life happened, again. Citizenship is a requirement for most and preference for all federal government jobs here, as there are strict security checks due to confidentiality, and as a resident (I’m not a citizen yet), the process is longer for me. The security check took ages, and neither I nor my employer had anticipated the long process and wait time. It got too late and that job slipped out of my hands. I was devastated. But that did not stop me and I took it as a ‘if I did it once, I can do it again’. I applied all over again, this time making sure it was way ahead of the start date so that there was sufficient time for the process to take place. Fortunately, things worked out this time and in January I started working at Employment and Social Development Canada (another federal government department). Looking back now, I feel that the first opportunity that did not work out, happened for the best. ESDC is the fourth largest department in the Government of Canada, and it aligns perfectly with the field I want to work in.

My journey got thwarted a number of times, but each time it happened for the best (which I could not see at that time, but I can see now as I look back). LUMS led me here, honing my skills and personality; providing opportunities for personal and professional development and preparing me fully to taken on life after graduation. I will not go into giving detailed advice as previous stories have already given great advice but I will say (to current and future LUMS students) that make the most of your LUMS experience: use classes and professors to hone your discussion and analytical skills; use societies and events to develop leadership, management and organisational skills; and use LAS and Culture Society, etc., to explore your adventurous side and the beauty Pakistan has, have the time of your life with your friends and make lasting memories.

If there’s one take away from this story it would be this: sometimes things don’t work out the way you want. Doors close. Plans fail. But it is important to keep trying. Open new doors. Make new plans. And if you persist, things will happen, perhaps better than you had planned. Maybe you cannot see it now when you do not get something you want, but looking back it all makes sense when you get something even better."
