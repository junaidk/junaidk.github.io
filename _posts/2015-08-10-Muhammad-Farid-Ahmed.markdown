**#LifeAfterGrad** for Muhammad Farid Ahmed (BSc (Hons) Economics-Class of 2007)

"The modern world measures success through one’s monetary and financial standing. On that scale I should be classified a ‘straggler’. At 30 I’m still at University, working towards a PhD in Economics. A majority of my peers, who graduated with me back in 2007 are very well settled in both their personal and professional lives and I am happy for them! Yet, my journey is less about where I am right now and more about how I got here and where I’m going. In a nutshell, I’m happy and content with the decisions I’ve made since that rainy December morning in 2007 (yes kids, graduation used to be in December in the Musharraf era). 

LUMS was more an accident than an inevitability (like it seems for some of the people here). Compared to others in my batch, my credentials were average at best and I was overawed by the people around me. Yet, I succeeded at mastering the system. In my opinion, what LUMS does best is give you the opportunity of discovering or re-discovering what you are good at; it enables you to carve a niche for yourself and succeed. A number of people go through their time at LUMS figuring out what they are good at; be it music, sport, politics, entrepreneurship or as in my case academics. However, I did not arrive at this conclusion during my initial stay at LUMS. These lessons would only be learnt during my ‘second coming.’

After graduating I spent 2 years in the UK completing graduate degrees in Economics and Investment Management respectively. The Economics program was brutal and where anything below a QGPA of 3.9 would have been a bitter disappointment at LUMS, I was lucky to have scratched and crawled my way through with a merit. (All of you doing Economics out there please TAKE GOOD COURSES). Finding a job was difficult in the heart of the financial crisis and it didn’t help that my people skills (at the time) were sub-par. Towards the tail end of my second masters and 200 job applications later, I managed to get into one of the big 4 audit firms in London but the job was to start the following year. Voila, the second coming and possibly my best year at LUMS!

As a teaching fellow I taught a few courses for the Economics faculty. Interacting with young Luminites was an exhilarating experience. I made my own hours (somewhat), had a great work environment AND I didn’t have to take any quizzes or exams (in fact I had to make them). The year helped me identify what I really wanted to do in life and my students’ feedback further added to my conviction. However, I had pressures and responsibilities to deal with just like most of us do. Most of these were my own insecurities, fuelled by a fear of failure, as my parents have been and continue to be extremely supportive. So instead of taking steps towards a career in academia I started with the audit firm. I would be lying if I said I did not enjoy the perks of being at a big company in a vibrant city. I gained ‘real life’ experience, made a lot of friends, learnt how to work under pressure in a fast paced and result oriented environment, discovered my love for photography and got an A.C.A; yet, I knew my heart was not in it. 

I made the difficult decision of leaving my job and essentially a chance to be a UK citizen and started my PhD. It has been two years since I re-started in academia. Just like most normal people, I have bad days when I regret a number of decisions that I have made, when I try to re-evaluate life and day dream of time traveling to an easier time. But those days are exceptions; I’m generally happy and enjoy what I do. I’m excited about the future when I hope to make a career in academia and do what I think I’m meant to do . Thank you if you have read this far! I have tried not to preach or mete out suggestions; I’m sure others on the page have done a better job of that already. You are all intelligent people and if there is anything worth taking away from my journey, you already will have. I sincerely hope that most of you identify your goals and objectives in life well before I did."
